|name|description|image|
|------|-----------|------|
|**engine module**|manages the movement and performance of the motors, as well as managing the flow of energy to prevent the motors or in this case the engine from burning out| ![module](https://github.com/nestoxuy/OSCORP/blob/main/other/Fotos/motor_module.jpg "motor module") |
| **Anti-Slip Wheels** |Designed to increase traction and reduce the risk of losing friction and slipping on the track |![Anti-Slip_Wheels](https://github.com/nestoxuy/OSCORP/blob/main/other/Fotos/non-slip_wheels.jpg "Anti-slip wheels")|
| **Color Sensor** |Measures light intensity at different wavelengths to determine object colors and sends signals to identify colors|![Color_Sensor](https://github.com/nestoxuy/OSCORP/blob/main/other/Fotos/color_sensor.jpg "Color_sensor")|
|**infrared sensor**|Infrared Sensor radiation (IR) through one LED acting as transmitter. The signal bounces back and is detected by another LED acting as receiver. Measures received IR radiation level and return time to calculate object distance|![Infrared_Sensor](https://github.com/nestoxuy/OSCORP/blob/main/other/Fotos/infrared_sensor.jpg "Infrared_sensor")|
| **Dupont Wires and Breadboard** | Dupont wires connect to Raspberry Pi5's programmable pins and provide electrical connections for sensors (5V and GND pins). The breadboard serves as intermediary for connections, facilitating pin management and power distribution for sensors|![Dupont_Wires_and_Breadboard](https://github.com/nestoxuy/OSCORP/blob/main/other/Fotos/ProtoBoard_and_Dupont_cables.jpeg "Dupont_wires_and_breadboard")|
| **Transparent Acrylic Bases** |Primary foundation for the entire assembly. The two-tiered base holds directional components/motors (lower level) and allows mounting/screwing of electronic components (upper level)|![Transparent_Acrylic_Bases](https://github.com/nestoxuy/OSCORP/blob/main/other/Fotos/base.jpg)
| **Raspberry Pi5**|The motherboard - the robot's brain. Features: 8GB RAM, 4GB ROM, dual 4K GPU support, PCI Express interface. Ports: 2x HDMI, 4x USB (2x USB2.0 + 2x USB3.0), Gigabit Ethernet, 27 programmable pins (2x 3V, 2x 5V, 8x GND), USB-C power, microSD slot. Power: 5V-3A (min) to 5V-5A (max)|![Raspberry_Pi5](https://github.com/nestoxuy/OSCORP/blob/main/other/Fotos/raspberry-pi-5-03.jpg "Raspberry_Pi5")|
| **Hexagonal Pillar Screw Kit**|Used to create structural pillars enabling two levels: Lower (motors/directional components) and upper (wiring, Raspberry Pi5, battery, breadboard, sensors)|![Hexagonal_Pillar_Screw_Kit](https://github.com/nestoxuy/OSCORP/blob/main/other/Fotos/Hexagonal_screw_kit_for_pillars.jpg "Hexagonal_pillar_screw_kit")|
| **7.4V 6200mAh Rechargeable Lithium Battery**|Primary power source for Raspberry Pi and installed sensors|![7.4V_6200mAh_Rechargeable_Lithium_Battery](https://github.com/nestoxuy/OSCORP/blob/main/other/Fotos/7.4V_6200mha_Rechargeable_Lithium_Battery.jpg "7.4V_6200mAh_rechargeable_lithium_battery")|
|**Current Regulator Module**|Critical component converting battery's 7.4V to stable 5V (exactly 4.99V), preventing shorts and protecting Raspberry Pi|![Current_Regulator_Module](https://github.com/nestoxuy/OSCORP/blob/main/other/Fotos/Current%20_regulator.jpg "Current_regulator")|
|**Cable Ties**|Secure Raspberry Pi, battery, and main wiring to prevent movement and pin disconnection|![Cable_Ties](https://github.com/nestoxuy/OSCORP/blob/main/other/Fotos/Tirrac.jpg "Cable_ties")|
| **Ultrasonic Sensor** |Responsible for sending ultrasonic waves that bounce off sufficiently solid objects and are received by the sensor to obtain environmental measurements. In short, it detects the robot's surroundings and measures distances |![Ultrasonic_Sensor](https://github.com/nestoxuy/OSCORP/blob/main/other/Fotos/ultrasound_sensor.jpg "ultrasonic_sensor")|
|**Differential motor mechanics of a toy car**|It allows the wheels to rotate at different speeds, especially during turns, while connected to the same axle. This is crucial for safe and efficient handling, preventing slippage, and with its included motor, it can move the robot both forward and backward|![Differential_motor_mechanics_of_a_toy_car](https://github.com/nestoxuy/OSCORP/blob/main/other/Fotos/Differential_motor_mechanics_of_a_toy_car.jpg)|
|**Mechanical steering of a toy car**|It helps steer the robot by transmitting force from the servomotor to the wheels to change the robot's direction and assist with its turns. The servomotor was adapted so that a plastic lever would fit perfectly into the slot in the turn signal, allowing the servomotor to transmit its force much better|![Mechanical_steering_of_a_toy_car](https://github.com/nestoxuy/OSCORP/blob/main/other/Fotos/Mechanical_steering_of_a_toy_car.jpg)|

# List of components tested but discarded

|**LED Diode, Button and Resistor** |Components indicating program execution: Red LED diode, program activation button, and 200Î© resistor preventing LED burnout|At first we used it as an indicator that the program was running but there came a time when it stopped working, the LED had not burned out so that was not the error we thought it was due to the programming since after a modification it stopped working, it turned out that there was a crash in the program and we preferred to discard the LED and use as an indicator the movement that the servomotor generated when it was activated|![LED_Diode,_Button_and_Resistor](https://github.com/nestoxuy/OSCORP/blob/main/other/Fotos/LED_button_diode_and_resistor.jpg "LED_diode,_button_and_resistor")|
