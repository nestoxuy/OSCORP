# brief summary of our evolution 
Throughout our time assembling the robot, there were various changes in its programming, in which we can see an evolution of the code, a use and disuse of some components, such as the color sensor, which we discarded due to a bug that occurred when using the color sensor and the ultrasound sensors, when there was an error in these we decided to leave the ultrasound sensor and the infrared sensors, the ultrasound sensors are responsible for detecting walls, and depending on which wall is closer, they will turn in reverse, sensor 1, located on the right side of the robot, when it detects that it has a wall nearby, it will indicate to the servomotor that it should turn left, in turn, sensor 2, which is on the left side of the robot, when it detects a wall it will go to the right side, and the infrared sensor when it detects that it has a wall in front of it, it will indicate to the motors that they should go back for a certain time in order to continue executing their actions
