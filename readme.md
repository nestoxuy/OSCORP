|[`models`](https://github.com/nestoxuy/OSCORP/tree/main/models)|This folder is empty because our robot does not need 3D printing or virtual modeling|
|[`other`](https://github.com/nestoxuy/OSCORP/tree/main/other)|It contains a list of components we've used, components we've tested and discarded because they didn't work as needed, and components that were implemented in the final version of the robot. It also includes two folders, one containing all the photos and the other containing all the recorded videos|
